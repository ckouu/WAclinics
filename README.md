## WA Clinic Tracker

This website was created with the purpose of providing easier accessibility to reproductive health resources, with the primary feature being an interactive map of reproductive health clinics in the Washington area. TypeScript, CSS, React, and NextJS were used to implement components like expandable Q&A tabs, while LeafletJS was used to create the map. The markers on the map (currently two example markers) are gathered from and connected to a Google Sheet which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OK4c-L0VQEHX8Bw7zNA_pFfRj487osocdktRXkIYlh0/edit?usp=sharing).

## Instructions

Clone the directory with ```git clone https://github.com/ckouu/WAclinics.git```. Navigate to the WAclinics directory with ```cd WAclinics``` and run: ```npm install```, then ```npm run dev```. Now, open WAclinics [here](http://localhost:3000/) at ```http://localhost:3000/```!

## Future Updates

This website is currently in progress, and all informational text blurbs have been temporarily replaced with filler text (Lorem ipsum). All outside links have also been temporarily replaced with links to search browsers. These will be replaced and updated in the future as more research is done!
